# Web-InteractiveWebsite
I made an interactive website for a game server. To respect them, i wont put up the source code here.
But as proof that i made it, credits are displayed at the bottom of the website, and, when clicked, it
shows what i did in the project (I did 90% of it including backend). Knoz9 is my github handle.
